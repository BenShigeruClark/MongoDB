# MongoDB

This assignment will create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news articles that are scraped from a news site.

Whenever a user visits this site, the app should scrape stories from a news outlet.  I have chosen Democracy Now!  Each scraped article should be saved to the application database.  The app should scrape the following information.

* Headline - Title of Article
* Summary - Short Summary of Article
* URL - URL to the Original Articlel

User should also be able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later.  The comments should be saved to the database as well and be associated with their articles. Users should also be able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments should be visible to every user.
